Getting Started with ALES
=

___
Welcome!
-
ALES is an HTML5 level editor for a Mario-style platformer. You can paint a level on the left-hand canvas and see it update automatically on the right-hand canvas.

___
The Map and the Editor
-
The map of the level is actually twice as wide and twice as tall as the area you can see in the game or in the editor. Because we can't see the whole map at once, we've added a minimap to the upper right of the editor.

**Tip:** to scroll the editor so you see a different part of the map, use the W, A, S, D keys on your keyboard. You can also move your mouse to an edge of the editor and the map will scroll in that direction.
___
Painting
-
Paint in the editor pane by clicking and dragging with the mouse.

You can choose new brushes by clicking on an image in the palette above the editor. The palette looks like this:

ALES provides full undo/redo. Press Ctrl+Z to undo, Ctrl+Y to redo. You can also use the mouse to undo/redo by clicking on these buttons:

___
Naming Your Level
-
You can name your level by typing in a new name here:

There's no need to press enter: the name automatically updates as you type.
___
Sharing Your Level
-
You can share the levels you make with friends! Just click on the "Generate a URL" link and copy it to your clipboard:

![Brushes.](./resources/tut_share.gif)

Anyone who visits that link will be able to play your level in **Game Mode**.
___
Game Mode
-
When you share a level with someone, they see it in game mode, where the editor is hidden and they get some tips on controls:

There's a link at the bottom of game mode that a visitor can click to edit their own copy of your level. Hopefully they'll build on what you've made it share it back with you!
___
Level History
-
ALES locally stores the entire undo history of every level you've ever made. As long as you're on the same computer using the same web browser, you can click here to view every revision you've ever made to any level:

You don't even have to worry about the current level you're editing: you can always get back to it by scrolling to the top and clicking the most recent level revision.
___
Resolution Problems?
-
ALES is best run on a widescreen monitor, but if your resolution is low enough that you don't see both canvases next to each other, just press Ctrl and - (minus) to zoom out with your browser.
___
Thank You!
-
Thanks for trying ALES! We hope you have fun putting levels together.
