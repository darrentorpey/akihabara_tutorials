Tips and tricks

1. ALES is best run on a widescreen monitor, but if your resolution is low enough that you don't see both canvases next to each other, just press Ctrl and - (minus) to zoom out with your browser.

1. To pan the map in the editor, we recommend using the W, A, S, D keys on your keyboard. You can also move your mouse to an edge of the editor and the map will pan in that direction.
